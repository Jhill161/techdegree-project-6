            | Hi, I'm Jason.  A Full Stack JavaScript Developer, Licensed Electrician, and Former Marine transfering my life skills to my life long passion in tech.
            | I studied Computer Science in Networking and Security in college after my time in the service, while attending my 5 year electrical apprenticeship and working full time as an apprentice.  Due to life and living costs in the bay area, for the last 10 years I decided to stick with electrical and the last 4.5 years as an electrical foreman and project manager running teams of up to 22 electricians building many projects around the S.F. Bay Area, CA.  My passion has always lead me back to the tech field so I enrolled in Treehouse Full Stack Tech Degree program to better learn to code.
            | Having learned many life, business, and soft skills along the way, coupled with my passion to continue to learn, I am looking for an opportunity to transfer them to a role as a software developer and grow with the company, and personally.
